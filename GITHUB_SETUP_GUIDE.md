# GitHub Repository Setup Guide for CounselFlow

## Your project is ready for GitHub! 🚀

The CounselFlow repository has been initialized with Git and is ready to be pushed to GitHub.

## Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** button in the top right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Configure your repository:
   - **Repository name**: `counselflow` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `AI-Native Legal Operating System - Enterprise-grade legal technology platform`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your Local Repository
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project (if not already there)
cd "C:\Users\Yadel Y. Endawoke\Desktop\CounselFlow"

# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/counselflow.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (If you want to install it)

### Install GitHub CLI
1. Download from: https://cli.github.com/
2. Install and restart PowerShell
3. Run: `gh auth login`
4. Create repository: `gh repo create counselflow --public --source=. --push`
