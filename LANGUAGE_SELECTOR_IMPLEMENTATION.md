## Location in UI
The language selector is located in the **top navigation bar** on the **right side**, positioned between the main content area and the search/notifications/profile section. It's visible on all pages that use the CorporateLayout.

## Usage
1. Click on the language selector (shows current flag + code)
2. Choose from the dropdown menu of 5 available languages
3. UI immediately updates to show content in the selected language
4. Selection is automatically saved for future sessions

The implementation provides a professional, enterprise-grade multi-language experience that maintains the clean, corporate aesthetic while offering seamless language switching functionality.
